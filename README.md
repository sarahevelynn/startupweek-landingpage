In this app, you will find the only tool you need for a successful Startup Week Denver. Use this app to find out about events, maintain your agenda, and track your leads throughout the week.

## Find out about events

* Swipe through the events of the week to ensure you find out about everything that is going on, and organize yourself later.
* Swipe right to add, swipe left to ignore. On swipe right, your event will be added to your agenda.

## Have your week agenda in one place

* See all your added events organized by day and time.
* If you have two events at one time you can use information to decide which one you want to go to.
  * Tap "See Description" to re-look at what each event is
  * Tap "Map Events" to map the walking distance from the previous event to this event
  * Swipe to delete whichever event you decide not to go to to keep your agenda organized

## Trake your leads for the week

* Add leads as you get them to your leads manager.
* Take a picture of a business card when you get it so you do not have to worry about losing it.
* Create a card to add the business card to an actionable lead with the following information.
  * Priority of lead (1-5) so you know which ones to get to first when the week is over
  * Category of lead (I can help them, They can help me, General Contact, Other) so you know where your responsibility lies
  * Leave a note so you don't have to remember what you told people you would do, you can just look back at what you said
* View your leads all in one place so you can systematically go through them when the week is over and monitor your progress!
